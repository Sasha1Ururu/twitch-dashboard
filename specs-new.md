Two levels to store various settings: Profile and Settings.
Note that Whiteboard font settings are stored in Profile, and Chat font settings are stored globally - in the Settings.
Also for all service/tool windows (all not the main 2 windows) - they must spawn in the center of the screen.
in UI: use "‚úì" instead of "enabled" and "‚®Ø" instead of "disabled" in yes/no toggles


# User Interface

## Views:
+ Chat view

##### Focus Management
- Focus must be maintained when interacting with header controls (font picker, color picker)
